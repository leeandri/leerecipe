I did this application following the course Symfony A to Z.

It allows registered users to create **recipes** based on common **ingredients**.
Each user can share or not his recipes to public

Some bundles used to create features in this project:

- [DoctrineFixturesBundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/current/index.html) and [FakePHP](https://fakerphp.github.io/) for generating false test data.

- [KnpPaginatorBundle](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpPaginatorBundle) to use a pagination system.

- [VichUploaderBundle](https://github.com/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle) to manage uploading pictures.

- [KarserRecaptcha3Bundle](https://github.com/karser/KarserRecaptcha3Bundle) to securise form contact submit with a Captcha.

- [EasyAdminBundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/index.html) to set up and administration backend.

- [FOSCKEditorBundle](https://symfony.com/bundles/FOSCKEditorBundle/current/installation.html) to set up an WYSIWYG system for the administration pannel

Deployment soon..stay tuned :)
